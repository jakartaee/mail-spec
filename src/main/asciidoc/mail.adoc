== Introduction

In the years since its first release, the
Java programming language has matured to become a platform. The Java
platform has added functionality, including distributed computing with
RMI and CORBA, and a component architecture (JavaBeans). Java
applications have also matured, and many need an addition to the Java
platform: a mail and messaging framework. The Jakarta Mail API described
in this specification satisfies that need.

The Jakarta Mail API provides a set of abstract
classes defining objects that comprise a mail system. The API defines
classes like Message, Store and Transport. The API can be extended and
can be subclassed to provide new protocols and to add functionality when
necessary.

In addition, the API provides concrete
subclasses of the abstract classes. These subclasses, including
MimeMessage and MimeBodyPart, implement widely used Internet mail
protocols and conform to specifications RFC822 and RFC2045. They are
ready to be used in application development.

=== Target Audience

The Jakarta Mail API is designed to serve several
audiences:

* Client, server, or middleware developers
interested in building mail and messaging applications using the Java
programming language.

* Application developers who need to
“mail-enable” their applications.

* Service Providers who need to implement
specific access and transfer protocols. For example; a
telecommunications company can use the Jakarta Mail API to implement a PAGER
Transport protocol that sends mail messages to alphanumeric pagers.

== Goals and Design Principles

The Jakarta Mail API is designed to make adding
electronic mail capability to simple applications easy, while also
supporting the creation of sophisticated user interfaces. It includes
appropriate convenience classes which encapsulate common mail functions
and protocols. It fits with other packages for the Java platform in
order to facilitate its use with other Java APIs, and it uses familiar
programming models.

The Jakarta Mail API is therefore designed to
satisfy the following development and runtime requirements:

* Simple, straightforward class design is easy
for a developer to learn and implement.

* Use of familiar concepts and programming
models support code development that interfaces well with other Java
APIs.

** Uses familiar exception-handling and JDK 1.1
event-handling programming models.

** Uses features from the Jakarta Activation
to handle access to data based on data-type and to
facilitate the addition of data types and commands on those data types.
The Jakarta Mail API provides convenience functions to simplify these coding
tasks.

* Lightweight classes and interfaces make it
easy to add basic mail-handling tasks to any application.

* Supports the development of robust
mail-enabled applications, that can handle a variety of complex mail
message formats, data types, and access and transport protocols.

The Jakarta Mail API draws heavily from IMAP,
MAPI, CMC, c-client and other messaging system APIs: many of the
concepts present in these other systems are also present in the Jakarta Mail
API. It is simpler to use because it uses features of the Java
programming language not available to these other APIs, and because it
uses the Java programming language’s object model to shelter
applications from implementation complexity.

The Jakarta Mail API design is driven by the needs
of the applications it supports—but it is also important to consider the
needs of API implementors. It is critically important to enable the
implementation of messaging systems written using the Java programming
language that interoperate with existing messaging systems—especially
Internet mail. It is also important to anticipate the development of new
messaging systems. The Jakarta Mail API conforms to current standards while
not being so constrained by current standards that it stifles future
innovation.

The Jakarta Mail API supports many different
messaging system implementations—different message stores, different
message formats, and different message transports. The Jakarta Mail API
provides a set of base classes and interfaces that define the API for
client applications. Many simple applications will only need to interact
with the messaging system through these base classes and interfaces.

Jakarta Mail subclasses can expose additional
messaging system features. For instance, the MimeMessage subclass
exposes and implements common characteristics of an Internet mail
message, as defined by RFC822 and MIME standards. Developers can
subclass Jakarta Mail classes to provide the implementations of particular
messaging systems, such as IMAP4, POP3, and SMTP.

The base Jakarta Mail classes include many
convenience APIs that simplify use of the API, but don’t add any
functionality. The implementation subclasses are not required to
implement those convenience methods. The implementation subclasses must
implement only the core classes and methods that provide functionality
required for the implementation.

Alternately, a messaging system can choose to
implement all of the Jakarta Mail API directly, allowing it to take
advantage of performance optimizations, perhaps through use of batched
protocol requests. The IMAP4 protocol implementation takes advantage of
this approach.

The Jakarta Mail API uses the Java programming
language to good effect to strike a balance between simplicity and
sophistication. Simple tasks are easy, and sophisticated functionality
is possible.



== Architectural Overview

This section describes the Jakarta Mail
architecture, defines major classes and interfaces comprising that
architecture, and lists major functions that the architecture
implements.

Jakarta Mail provides elements that are used to
construct an interface to a messaging system, including system
components and interfaces. While this specification does not define any
specific implementation, Jakarta Mail does include several classes that
implement RFC822 and MIME Internet messaging standards. These classes
are delivered as part of the Jakarta Mail class package.

=== Jakarta Mail Layered Architecture

The Jakarta Mail architectural components are
layered as shown below:

* The Abstract Layer declares classes,
interfaces and abstract methods intended to support mail handling
functions that all mail systems support. API elements comprising the
Abstract Layer are intended to be subclassed and extended as necessary
in order to support standard data types, and to interface with message
access and message transport protocols as necessary.

* The internet implementation layer implements
part of the abstract layer using internet standards - RFC822 and MIME.

* Jakarta Mail uses Jakarta Activation
in order to encapsulate message data, and to handle
commands intended to interact with that data. Interaction with message
data should take place via JAF-aware JavaBeans, which are not provided
by the Jakarta Mail API.

Jakarta Mail clients use the Jakarta Mail API and
Service Providers implement the Jakarta Mail API. The layered design
architecture allows clients to use the same Jakarta Mail API calls to send,
receive and store a variety of messages using different data-types from
different message stores and using different message transport
protocols.

=== Jakarta Mail Class Hierarchy

The figure below shows major classes and
interfaces comprising the Jakarta Mail API.
See <<a63, Major Jakarta Mail API Components>> for
brief descriptions of all components shown on this diagram.

image:images/mail-5.svg[image]

=== The Jakarta Mail Framework

The Jakarta Mail API is intended to perform the
following functions, which comprise the standard mail handling process
for a typical client application:

* Create a mail message consisting of a
collection of header attributes and a block of data of some known data
type as specified in the _Content-Type_ header field. Jakarta Mail uses the
Part interface and the Message class to define a mail message. It uses
the JAF-defined DataHandler object to contain data placed in the
message.

* Create a Session object, which authenticates
the user, and controls access to the message store and transport.

* Send the message to its recipient list.

* Retrieve a message from a message store.

* Execute a high-level command on a retrieved
message. High-level commands like _view_ and _print_ are intended to be
implemented via Activation-Aware JavaBeans.

NOTE: The Jakarta Mail framework does not define mechanisms that support message
delivery, security, disconnected operation, directory services or filter
functionality.

This figure illustrates the Jakarta Mail
message-handling process.

[[a63]]
=== Major Jakarta Mail API Components

This section reviews major components
comprising the Jakarta Mail architecture.

==== The `Message` Class

The Message class is an abstract class that
defines a set of attributes and a content for a mail message. Attributes
of the Message class specify addressing information and define the
structure of the content, including the content type. The content is
represented as a DataHandler object that wraps around the actual data.

The Message class implements the Part
interface. The Part interface defines attributes that are required to
define and format data content carried by a Message object, and to
interface successfully to a mail system. The Message class adds From,
To, Subject, Reply-To, and other attributes necessary for message
routing via a message transport system. When contained in a folder, a
Message object has a set of flags associated with it. Jakarta Mail provides
Message subclasses that support specific messaging implementations.

The content of a message is a collection of
bytes, or a reference to a collection of bytes, encapsulated within a
Message object. Jakarta Mail has no knowledge of the data type or format of
the message content. A Message object interacts with its content through
an intermediate layer - Jakarta Activation. This
separation allows a Message object to handle any arbitrary content and
to transmit it using any appropriate transmission protocol by using
calls to the same API methods. The message recipient usually knows the
content data type and format and knows how to handle that content.

The Jakarta Mail API also supports multipart
Message objects, where each Bodypart defines its own set of attributes
and content.

==== Message Storage and Retrieval

Messages are stored in Folder objects. A
Folder object can contain subfolders as well as messages, thus providing
a tree-like folder hierarchy. The Folder class declares methods that
fetch, append, copy and delete messages. A Folder object can also send
events to components registered as event listeners.

The Store class defines a database that holds
a folder hierarchy together with its messages. The Store class also
specifies the _access_ protocol that accesses folders and retrieves
messages stored in folders. The Store class also provides methods to
establish a connection to the database, to fetch folders and to close a
connection. Service providers implementing Message Access protocols
(IMAP4, POP3, etc.) start off by subclassing the Store class. A user
typically starts a session with the mail system by connecting to a
particular Store implementation.

==== Message Composition and Transport

A client creates a new message by
instantiating an appropriate Message subclass. It sets attributes like
the recipient addresses and the subject, and inserts the content into
the Message object. Finally, it sends the Message by invoking the
Transport.send method.

The Transport class models the transport agent
that routes a message to its destination addresses. This class provides
methods that send a message to a list of recipients. Invoking the
Transport.send method with a Message object identifies the appropriate
transport based on its destination addresses.

==== The `Session` Class

The Session class defines global and per-user
mail-related properties that define the interface between a mail-enabled
client and the network. Jakarta Mail system components use the Session
object to set and get specific properties. The Session class also
provides a default authenticated session object that desktop
applications can share. The Session class is a final concrete class. It
cannot be subclassed.

The Session class also acts as a factory for
Store and Transport objects that implement specific access and transport
protocols. By calling the appropriate factory method on a Session
object, the client can obtain Store and Transport objects that support
specific protocols.

=== The Jakarta Mail Event Model

The Jakarta Mail event model conforms to the JDK
1.1 event-model specification, as described in the JavaBeans
Specification. The Jakarta Mail API follows the design patterns defined in
the JavaBeans Specification for naming events, event methods and event
listener registration.

All events are subclassed from the MailEvent
class. Clients listen for specific events by registering themselves as
listeners for those events. Events notify listeners of state changes as
a session progresses. During a session, a Jakarta Mail component generates a
specific event-type to notify objects registered as listeners for that
event-type. The Jakarta Mail Store, Folder, and Transport classes are event
sources. This specification describes each specific event in the section
that describes the class that generates that event.

=== Using the Jakarta Mail API

This section defines the syntax and lists the
order in which a client application calls some Jakarta Mail methods in order
to access and open a message located in a folder:

. A Jakarta Mail client typically begins a mail
handling task by obtaining a Jakarta Mail Session object.
+
[source,java]
----
 Session session = Session.getInstance(props, authenticator);
----
+
. The client uses the Session object’s getStore
method to connect to the default store. The getStore method returns a
Store object subclass that supports the access protocol defined in the
user properties object, which will typically contain per-user
preferences.
+
[source,java]
----
 Store store = session.getStore();

 store.connect();
----
+
. If the connection is successful, the client
can list available folders in the Store, and then fetch and view
specific Message objects.
+
[source,java]
----
 // get the INBOX folder
 Folder inbox = store.getFolder("INBOX");

 // open the INBOX folder
 inbox.open(Folder.READ_WRITE);

 Message m = inbox.getMessage(1); // get Message # 1
 String subject = m.getSubject(); // get Subject
 Object content = m.getContent(); // get content
 ...
----
+
. Finally, the client closes all open folders,
and then closes the store.
+
[source,java]
----
 inbox.close(); // Close the INBOX
 store.close(); // Close the Store
----

See <<a856, Examples Using the Jakarta Mail API>> for a more complete example.


== The Message Class

The Message class defines a set of attributes
and a content for a mail message. Message attributes specify message
addressing information and define the structure of the content,
including the content type. The content is represented by a DataHandler
object that wraps around the actual data. The Message class is an
abstract class that implements the Part interface.

Subclasses of the Message classes can
implement several standard message formats. For example, the Jakarta Mail
API provides the MimeMessage class, that extends the Message class to
implement the RFC822 and MIME standards. Implementations can typically
construct themselves from byte streams and generate byte streams for
transmission.

A Message subclass instantiates an object that
holds message content, together with attributes that specify addresses
for the sender and recipients, structural information about the message,
and the content type of the message body. Messages placed into a folder
also have a set of flags that describe the state of the message within
the folder.

The figure below illustrates the structure of
the Message class.

image:images/mail-8.svg[image]

The Message object has no direct knowledge of
the nature or semantics of its content. This separation of structure
from content allows the message object to contain any arbitrary content.

Message objects are either retrieved from a
Folder object or constructed by instantiating a new Message object of
the appropriate subclass. Messages stored within a Folder object are
sequentially numbered, starting at one. An assigned message number can
change when the folder is expunged, since the expunge operation removes
deleted messages from the folder and also renumbers the remaining
messages.

A Message object can contain multiple parts,
where each part contains its own set of attributes and content. The
content of a multipart message is a Multipart object that contains
BodyPart objects representing each individual part. The Part interface
defines the structural and semantic similarity between the Message class
and the BodyPart class.

The figure below illustrates a Message
instance hierarchy, where the message contains attributes, a set of
flags, and content.
See <<a1917, MimeMessage Object Hierarchy>> for an illustration of
the MimeMessage object hierarchy.

image:images/mail-9.svg[image]

The Message class provides methods to perform
the following tasks:

* Get, set and create its attributes and
content:

[source,java]
----
 public String getSubject() throws MessagingException;

 public void setSubject(String subject) throws MessagingException;

 public String[] getHeader(String name) throws MessagingException;

 public void setHeader(String name, String value) throws MessagingException;

 public Object getContent() throws MessagingException;

 public void setContent(Object content, String type) throws MessagingException
----

* Save changes to its containing folder.

[source,java]
----
 public void saveChanges() throws MessagingException;
----

This method also ensures that the Message
header fields are updated to be consistent with the changed message
contents.

* Generate a bytestream for the Message object.

[source,java]
----
 public void writeTo(OutputStream os) throws IOException, MessagingException;
----

This byte stream can be used to save the
message or send it to a Transport object.

=== The `Part` Interface

The Part interface defines a set of standard
headers common to most mail systems, specifies the data-type assigned to
data comprising a content block, and defines set and get methods for
each of these members. It is the basic data component in the Jakarta Mail
API and provides a common interface for both the Message and BodyPart
classes. See the Jakarta Mail API (Javadoc) documentation for details.

NOTE: A Message object can not be contained directly in a Multipart object,
but must be embedded in a BodyPart first.

==== Message Attributes

The Message class adds its own set of standard
attributes to those it inherits from the Part interface. These
attributes include the sender and recipient addresses, the subject,
flags, and sent and received dates. The Message class also supports
non-standard attributes in the form of headers. See the Jakarta Mail API
(Javadoc) Documentation for the list of standard attributes defined in
the Message class. Not all messaging systems will support arbitrary
headers, and the availability and meaning of particular header names is
specific to the messaging system implementation.

==== The `ContentType` Attribute

The contentType attribute specifies the data
type of the content, following the MIME typing specification (RFC 2045).
A MIME type is composed of a primary type that declares the general type
of the content, and a subtype that specifies a specific format for the
content. A MIME type also includes an optional set of type-specific
parameters.

Jakarta Mail API components can access content via
these mechanisms:

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *As an input stream*
|The Part interface declares the
_getInputStream_ method that returns an input stream to the content.
Note that Part implementations must decode any mail-specific transfer
encoding before providing the input stream.

|  *As a DataHandler object*
|The Part interface declares the
_getDataHandler_ method that returns a _jakarta.activation.DataHandler_
object that wraps around the content. The DataHandler object allows
clients to discover the operations available to perform on the content,
and to instantiate the appropriate component to perform those
operations. See <<a483, Jakarta Activation>>
for details describing the data typing framework

|  *As an object in the Java programming language*
|The Part interface declares the _getContent_
method that returns the content as an object in the Java programming
language. The type of the returned object is dependent on the content’s
data type. If the content is of type multipart, the _getContent_ method
returns a Multipart object, or a Multipart subclass object. The
_getContent_ method returns an input stream for unknown content-types.
Note that the getContent method uses the DataHandler internally to
obtain the native form.
|===

The _setDataHandler(DataHandler)_ method
specifies content for a new Part object, as a step toward the
construction of a new message. The Part also provides some convenience
methods to set up most common content types.

Part provides the _writeTo_ method that writes
its byte stream in mail-safe form suitable for transmission. This byte
stream is typically an aggregation of the Part attributes and the byte
stream for its content.

=== The `Address` Class

The Address class represents email addresses.
The Address class is an abstract class. Subclasses provide
implementation-specific semantics.

=== The `BodyPart` Class

The BodyPart class is an abstract class that
implements the Part interface in order to define the attribute and
content body definitions that Part declares. It does not declare
attributes that set From, To, Subject, ReplyTo, or other address header
fields, as a Message object does.

A BodyPart object is intended to be inserted
into a Multipart container, later accessed via a multipart message.

=== The `Multipart` Class

The Multipart class implements multipart
messages. A multipart message is a Message object where the content-type
specifier has been set to multipart. The Multipart class is a container
class that contains objects of type Bodypart. A Bodypart object is an
instantiation of the Part interface—it contains either a new Multipart
container object, or a DataHandler object.

The figure below illustrates the structure and
content of a multipart message:

image:images/mail-12.svg[image]

Note that Multipart objects can be nested to
any reasonable depth within a multipart message, in order to build an
appropriate structure for data carried in DataHandler objects.
Therefore, it is important to check the ContentType header for each
BodyPart element stored within a Multipart container. The figure below
illustrates a typical nested Multipart message.

image:images/mail-13.svg[image]

Typically, the client calls the getContentType
method to get the content type of a message. If getContentType returns a
MIME-type whose primary type is multipart, then the client calls
getContent to get the Multipart container object.

The Multipart object supports several methods
that get, create, and remove individual BodyPart objects.

[source,java]
----
 public int getCount() throws MessagingException;

 public Body getBodyPart(int index) throws MessagingException;

 public void addBodyPart(BodyPart part) throws MessagingException;

 public void removeBodyPart(BodyPart body) throws MessagingException;

 public void removeBodyPart(int index) throws MessagingException;
----

The _Multipart_ class implements the
_jakarta.activation.DataSource_ interface. It can act as the _DataSource_
object for _jakarta.activation.DataHandler_ and
_jakarta.activation.DataContentHandler_ objects. This allows message-aware
content handlers to handle multipart data sources more efficiently,
since the data has already been parsed into individual parts.

This diagram illustrates the structure of a
multipart message, and shows calls from the associated _Message_ and
Multipart objects, for a typical call sequence returning a BodyPart
containing text/plain content.

image:images/mail-14.svg[image]

In this figure, the _ContentType_ attribute of
a Message object indicates that it holds a multipart content. Use the
getContent method to obtain the Multipart object.

This code sample below shows the retrieval of
a Multipart object. See <<a856, Examples Using the Jakarta Mail API>>
for examples that traverse a multipart message and
examples that create new multipart messages.

[source,java]
----
Multipart mp = (Multipart)message.getContent();

int count = mp.getCount();
BodyPart body_part;

for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
    body_part = mp.getBodyPart(i);
----

=== The `Flags` Class

Flags objects carry flag settings that
describe the state of a Message object within its containing folder. The
Message.getFlags method returns a Flags object that holds all the flags
currently set for that message.

The _setFlags(Flags f, boolean set)_ method
sets the specified flags for that message. The _add(Flags.Flag f_ )
method on a Flags object sets the specified flag; the
_contains(Flags.Flag f_ ) method returns whether the specified flag is
set.

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%"]
|===
|  *ANSWERED*
|Clients set this flag to indicate that this
message has been answered.

|  *DRAFT*
|Indicates that this message is a draft.

|  *FLAGGED*
|No defined semantics. Clients can use this
flag to mark a message in some user-defined manner.

|  *RECENT*
|This message is newly arrived in this folder.
This flag is set when the message is first delivered into the folder and
cleared when the containing folder is closed. Clients cannot set this
flag.

|  *SEEN*
|Marks a message that has been opened. A
client sets this flag implicitly when the message contents are
retrieved.

|  *DELETED*
|Allows undoable message deletion. Setting
this flag for a message marks it _deleted_ but does not physically
remove the message from its folder. The client calls the _expunge_
method on a folder to remove all deleted messages in that folder.
|===

Note that a folder is not guaranteed to
support either standard system flags or arbitrary user flags. The
_getPermanentFlags_ method in a folder returns a Flags object that
contains all the system flags supported by that Folder implementation.
The presence of the special USER flag indicates that the client can set
arbitrary user-definable flags on any message belonging to this folder.

=== Message Creation And Transmission

The Message class is abstract, so an
appropriate subclass must be instantiated to create a new Message
object. A client creates a message by instantiating an appropriate
Message subclass.

For example, the MimeMessage subclass handles
Internet email messages. Typically, the client application creates an
email message by instantiating a MimeMessage object, and passing
required attribute values to that object. In an email message, the
client defines Subject, From, and To attributes. The client then passes
message _content_ into the MimeMessage object by using a suitably
configured DataHandler object. See <<a554, Message Composition>> for details.

After the Message object is constructed, the
client calls the _Transport.send_ method to route it to its specified
recipients. See <<a674, Transport Protocols and Mechanisms>>
for a discussion of the transport process.



[[a219]]
== The Mail Session

A mail _Session_ object manages the
configuration options and user authentication information used to
interact with messaging systems.

The Jakarta Mail API supports simultaneous
multiple sessions. Each session can access multiple message stores and
transports. Any desktop application that needs to access the current
primary message store can share the default session. Typically the
mail-enabled application establishes the default session, which
initializes the authentication information necessary to access the
user’s Inbox folder. Other desktop applications then use the default
session when sending or accessing mail on behalf of the user. When
sharing the session object, all applications share authentication
information, properties, and the rest of the state of the object.

For example,

* To create a _Session_ using a static factory method:
--
[source,java]
----
 Session session = Session.getInstance(props, authenticator);
----
--
* To create the default shared session, or to
access the default shared session:
--
[source,java]
----
 Session defaultSession = Session.getDefaultInstance(props, authenticator);
----
--

The _Properties_ object that initializes the
_Session_ contains default values and other configuration information.
It is expected that clients using the APIs set the values for the listed
properties, especially _mail.host_ , _mail.user_ , and _mail.from_ ,
since the defaults are unlikely to work in all cases.
See <<a823, Environment Properties>> for a list
of properties used by the Jakarta Mail APIs and their defaults.

Some messaging system implementations can use
additional properties. Typically the properties object contains
user-defined customizations in addition to system-wide defaults.
Mail-enabled application logic determines the appropriate set of
properties. Lacking a specific requirement, the application can use the
system properties object retrieved from the System.getProperties method.

The _Authenticator_ object controls security
aspects for the Session object. The messaging system uses it as a
callback mechanism to interact with the user when a password is required
to login to a messaging system. It indirectly controls access to the
default session, as described below.

Clients using Jakarta Mail can register
PasswordAuthentication objects with the Session object for use later in
the session or for use by other users of the same session. Because
PasswordAuthentication objects contain passwords, access to this
information must be carefully controlled. Applications that create
Session objects must restrict access to those objects appropriately. In
addition, the Session class shares some responsibility for controlling
access to the default session object.

The first call to the getDefaultInstance
method creates a new _Session_ object and associates it with the
_Authenticator_ object. Subsequent calls to the getDefaultInstance
method compare the _Authenticator_ object passed in with the
_Authenticator_ object saved in the default session. Access to the
default session is allowed if both objects have been loaded by the same
class loader. Typically, this is the case when both the default session
creator and the program requesting default session access are in the
same "security domain." Also, if both objects are _null_ , access is
allowed. Using _null_ to gain access is discouraged, because this allows
access to the default session from any security domain.

A mail-enabled client uses the Session object
to retrieve a Store or Transport object in order to read or send mail.
Typically, the client retrieves the default Store or Transport object
based on properties loaded for that session:

[source,java]
----
Store store = session.getStore();
----

The client can override the session defaults
and access a Store or Transport object that implements a particular
protocol.

[source,java]
----
Store store = session.getStore("imap");
----

See <<a240, The Provider Registry>> for details.

Implementations of Store and Transport objects
will be told the session to which they have been assigned. They can then
make the Session object available to other objects contained within this
Store or Transport objects using application-dependent logic.

[[a240]]
=== The Provider Registry

The Provider Registry allows providers to
register their protocol implementations to be used by Jakarta Mail APIs. It
provides a mechanism for discovering available protocol, for registering
new protocols, and for specifying default implementations.

==== Resource Files

The providers for Jakarta Mail APIs are configured
using the following files:

* _javamail.providers_ and _javamail.default.providers_
* _javamail.address.map_ and _javamail.default.address.map_

Each `javamail.X` resource file is searched in
the following order:

. _java.home_ _/lib/javamail.X_
. _META-INF/javamail.X_
. _META-INF/javamail.default.X_

The first method allows the user to include
their own version of the resource file by placing it in the lib
directory where the java.home property points. The second method allows
an application that uses the Jakarta Mail APIs to include their own resource
files in their application’s or jar file’s META-INF directory. The
_javamail.default.X_ default files are part of the Jakarta Mail _mail.jar_
file.

File location depends upon how the
_ClassLoader.getResource_ method is implemented. Usually, the
_getResource_ method searches through CLASSPATH until it finds the
requested file and then stops. JDK 1.2 and newer allows all resources of
a given name to be loaded from all elements of the CLASSPATH. However,
this only affects method two, above; method one is loaded from a
specific location (if allowed by the SecurityManager) and method three
uses a different name to ensure that the default resource file is always
loaded successfully.

The ordering of entries in the resource files
matters. If multiple entries exist, the first entries take precedence
over the latter entries as the initial defaults. For example, the first
IMAP provider found will be set as the default IMAP implementation until
explicitly changed by the application.

The user- or system-supplied resource files
augment, they do not override, the default files included with the
Jakarta Mail APIs. This means that all entries in all files loaded will be
available.

===== javamail.providers and javamail.default.providers

These resource files specify the stores and
transports that are available on the system, allowing an application to
"discover" what store and transport implementations are available. The
protocol implementations are listed one per line. The file format
defines four attributes that describe a protocol implementation. Each
attribute is an "="-separated name-value pair with the name in
lowercase. Each name-value pair is semi-colon (";") separated.

.Protocol Attributes

Here’s an example of
_META-INF/javamail.default.providers_ file contents:

[source]
----
protocol=imap; type=store; class=com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore; vendor=Sun;

protocol=smtp; type=transport; class=com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport;
----

===== javamail.address.map and javamail.default.address.map

These resource files map transport address
types to the transport protocol. The _jakarta.mail.Address.getType()_
method returns the address type. The _javamail.address.map_ file maps
the transport type to the protocol. The file format is a series of
name-value pairs. Each key name should correspond to an address type
that is currently installed on the system; there should also be an entry
for each _jakarta.mail.Address_ implementation that is present if it is to
be used. For example, _jakarta.mail.internet.InternetAddress.getType()_
returns rfc822. Each referenced protocol should be installed on the
system. For the case of news, below, the client should install a
Transport provider supporting the nntp protocol.

Here are the typical contents of a
_javamail.address.map_ file.

[source]

rfc822=smtp
news=nntp
----

==== Provider

Provider is a class that describes a protocol
implementation. The values come from the _javamail.providers_ and
_javamail.default.providers_ resource files.

==== Protocol Selection and Defaults

The constructor for the Session object
initializes the appropriate variables from the resource files. The order
of the protocols in the resource files determines the initial defaults
for protocol implementations. The methods, _getProviders()_ ,
_getProvider()_ and _setProvider()_ allow the client to discover the
available (installed) protocol implementations, and to set the protocols
to be used by default.

At runtime, an application may set the default
implementation for a particular protocol. It can set the _mail.protocol.class_
property when it creates the Session object. This property
specifies the class to use for a particular protocol. The
_getProvider()_ method consults this property first.

The code can also call _setProviders()_
passing in a Provider that was returned by the discovery methods. A
Provider object in not normally explicitly created; it is usually
retrieved using the _getProviders()_ method.

In either case, the provider specified is one
of the ones configured in the resource files. An application may also
instantiate a _Provider_ object to configure a new implementation.

==== Example Scenarios

*Scenario 1:* The client application invokes the
default protocols:

[source,java]
----
class Application1 {
    init() {
        // application properties include the Jakarta Mail
        // required properties: mail.store.protocol,
        // mail.transport.protocol, mail.host, mail.user
        Properties props = loadApplicationProps();
        Session session = Session.getInstance(props, null);
       
        // get the store implementation of the protocol
        // defined in mail.store.protocol; the implementation
        // returned will be defined by the order of entries in
        // javamail.providers & javamail.default.providers
        try {
            Store store = session.getStore();
            store.connect();
        } catch (MessagingException mex) {}
        ...
    }
}
----

*Scenario 2:* The client application presents
available implementations to the user and then sets the user’s choice as
the default implementation:

[source,java]
----
class Application2 {
    init() {
        // application properties include the Jakarta Mail
        // properties: mail.store.protocol,
        // mail.transport.protocol, mail.host, mail.user
        Properties props = loadApplicationProps();
        Session session = Session.getInstance(props, null);

        // find out which implementations are available
        Provider[] providers = session.getProviders();

        // ask the user which implementations to use
        // user’s response may include a number of choices,
        // i.e. imap & nntp store providers & smtp transport
        Provider[] userChosenProviders =
            askUserWhichProvidersToUse(providers);

        // set the defaults based on users response
        for (int i = 0; i < userChosenProviders.length; i++)
            session.setProvider(userChosenProviders[i]);

        // get the store implementation of the protocol
        // defined in mail.store.protocol; the implementation
        // returned will be the one configured previously
        try {
            Store store = session.getStore();
            store.connect();
        } catch (MessagingException mex) {}
        ...
    }
}
----

*Scenario 3:* Application wants to specify an
implementation for a given protocol:

[source,java]
----
class Application3 {
    init() {
        // application properties include the Jakarta Mail
        // required properties: mail.store.protocol,
        // mail.transport.protocol, mail.host, mail.user
        Properties props = loadApplicationProps();

        // hard-code an implementation to use
        // "com.acme.SMTPTRANSPORT"

        props.put("mail.smtp.class", "com.acme.SMTPTRANSPORT");
        Session session = Session.getInstance(props, null);

        // get the smtp transport implementation; the
        // implementation returned will be com.acme.SMTPTRANSPORT
        // if it was correctly configured in the resource files.
        // If com.acme.SMTPTRANSPORT can’t be loaded, a
        // MessagingException is thrown.
        try {
            Transport transport = session.getTransport("smtp");
        } catch (MessagingException mex) {
            quit();
        }
    }
    ...
}
----

=== Managing Security

The Session class allows messaging system
implementations to use the Authenticator object that was registered when
the session was created. The Authenticator object is created by the
application and allows interaction with the user to obtain a user name
and password. The user name and password is returned in a
PasswordAuthentication object. The messaging system implementation can
ask the session to associate a user name and password with a particular
message store using the _setPasswordAuthentication_ method. This
information is retrieved using the _getPasswordAuthentication_ method.
This avoids the need to ask the user for a password when reconnecting to
a Store that has disconnected, or when a second application sharing the
same session needs to create its own connection to the same Store.

Messaging system implementations can register
PasswordAuthentication objects with the Session object for use later in
the session or for use by other users of the same session. Because
PasswordAuthentication objects contain passwords, access to this
information must be carefully controlled. Applications that create
Session objects must restrict access to those objects appropriately. In
addition, the Session class shares some responsibility for controlling
access to the default Session object.

The first call to _getDefaultInstance_ creates
a new Session object and associates the Authenticator object with the
Session object. Later calls to _getDefaultInstance_ compare the
Authenticator object passed in, to the Authenticator object saved in the
default session. If both objects have been loaded by the same class
loader, then _getDefaultInstance_ will allow access to the default
session. Typically, this is the case when both the creator of the
default session and the code requesting access to the default session
are in the same "security domain." Also, if both objects are null,
access is allowed. This last case is discouraged because setting objects
to _null_ allows access to the default session from any security domain.

In the future, JDK security Permissions could
control access to the default session. Note that the Authenticator and
PasswordAuthentication classes and their use in Jakarta Mail is similar to
the classes with the same names provided in the _java.net_ package in
the JDK. As new authentication mechanisms are added to the system, new
methods can be added to the Authenticator class to request the needed
information. The default implementations of these new methods will fail,
but new clients that understand these new authentication mechanisms can
provide implementations of these methods. New classes other than
PasswordAuthentication could be needed to contain the new authentication
information, and new methods could be needed in the Session class to
store such information. Jakarta Mail design evolution will be patterned
after the corresponding JDK classes.

=== Store and Folder URLs

To simplify message folder naming and to
minimize the need to manage Store and Transport objects, folders can be
named using URLNames. URLNames are similar to URLs except they only
include the parsing of the URL string. The Session class provides
methods to retrieve a Folder object given a URLName:

[source,java]
----
Folder f = session.getFolder(URLName);
----

or

[source,java]
----
Store s = session.getStore(URLName);
----

== Message Storage And Retrieval

This section describes Jakarta Mail message
storage facilities supported by the Store and Folder classes.

Messages are contained in Folders. New
messages are usually delivered to folders by a transport protocol or a
delivery agent. Clients retrieve messages from folders using an access
protocol.

[[a378]]
=== The `Store` Class

The Store class defines a database that holds
a Folder hierarchy and the messages within. The Store also defines the
access protocol used to access folders and retrieve messages from
folders. Store is an abstract class. Subclasses implement specific
message databases and access protocols.

Clients gain access to a Message Store by
obtaining a Store object that implements the database access protocol.
Most message stores require the user to be authenticated before they
allow access. The connect method performs that authentication.

For many message stores, a host name, user
name, and password are sufficient to authenticate a user. The Jakarta Mail
API provides a connect method that takes this information as input
parameters. Store also provides a default connect method. In either
case, the client can obtain missing information from the Session
object’s properties, or by interacting with the user by accessing the
Session’s Authenticator object.

The default implementation of the connect
method in the Store class uses these techniques to retrieve all needed
information and then calls the _protocolConnect_ method. The messaging
system must provide an appropriate implementation of this method. The
messaging system can also choose to directly override the _connect_
method.

By default, Store queries the following
properties for the user name and host name:

* _mail.user_ property, or _user.name_ system
property (if _mail.user_ is not set)
* _mail.host_

These global defaults can be overridden on a
per-protocol basis by the properties:

* _mail.protocol.user_
* _mail.protocol.host_

Note that passwords can not be specified using
properties.

The Store presents a default namespace to
clients. Store implementations can also present other namespaces. The
_getDefaultFolder_ method on Store returns the root folder for the
default namespace.

Clients terminate a session by calling the
_close_ method on the Store object. Once a Store is closed (either
explicitly using the _close_ method; or externally, if the Mail server
fails), all Messaging components belonging to that Store become invalid.
Typically, clients will try to recover from an unexpected termination by
calling connect to reconnect to the Store object, and then fetching new
Folder objects and new Message objects.

====  `Store` Events

Store sends the following events to interested
listeners:

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",]
|===
| *ConnectionEvent*
|Generated when a connection is successfully
made to the _Store_ , or when an existing connection is terminated or
disconnected.

| *StoreEvent*
|Communicates alerts and notification messages
from the Store to the end user. The getMessageType method returns the
event type, which can be one of: _ALERT_ or _NOTICE_ . The client must
display _ALERT_ events in some fashion that calls the user’s attention
to the message.

| *FolderEvent*
|Communicates changes to any folder contained
within the _Store_ . These changes include creation of a new _Folder_ ,
deletion of an existing _Folder_ , and renaming of an existing _Folder_.
|===

[[a401]]
=== The `Folder` Class

The Folder class represents a folder
containing messages. Folders can contain subfolders as well as messages,
thus providing a hierarchical structure. The _getType_ method returns
whether a Folder can hold subfolders, messages, or both. Folder is an
abstract class. Subclasses implement protocol-specific Message Folders.

The _getDefaultFolder_ method for the
corresponding Store object returns the root folder of a user’s default
folder hierarchy. The _list_ method for a Folder returns all the
subfolders under that folder. The _getFolder_ ( _String_ name) method
for a Folder object returns the named subfolder. Note that this
subfolder need not exist physically in the store. The exists method in a
folder indicates whether this folder exists. A folder is created in the
store by invoking its _create_ method.

A closed Folder object allows certain
operations, including deleting the folder, renaming the folder, listing
subfolders, creating subfolders and monitoring for new messages. The
open method opens a Folder object. All Folder methods except _open_ ,
_delete,_ and renameTo are valid on an open Folder object. Note that the
_open_ method is applicable only on Folder objects that can contain
messages.

The messages within a Folder are sequentially
numbered, from 1 through the total number of messages. This ordering is
referred to as the “ _mailbox order_ ” and is usually based on the
arrival time of the messages in the folder. As each new message arrives
into a folder, it is assigned a sequence number that is one higher than
the previous number of messages in that folder. The getMessageNumber
method on a Message object returns its sequence number.

The sequence number assigned to a Message
object is valid within a session, but only as long as it retains its
relative position within the Folder. Any change in message ordering can
change the Message object's sequence number. Currently this occurs when
the client calls expunge to remove deleted messages and renumber
messages remaining in the folder.

A client can reference a message stored within
a Folder either by its sequence number, or by the corresponding Message
object itself. Since a sequence number can change within a session, it
is preferable to use Message objects rather than sequence numbers as
cached references to messages. Clients extending Jakarta Mail are expected
to provide light-weight Message objects that get filled ’on-demand’, so
that calling the _getMessages_ method on a Folder object is an _in_
expensive operation, both in terms of CPU cycles and memory. For
instance, an IMAP implementation could return Message objects that
contain only the corresponding IMAP UIDs.

==== The `FetchProfile` Method

The Message objects returned by a Folder
object are expected to be light-weight objects. Invoking get__xxx__
methods on a Message cause the corresponding data items to be loaded
into the object on demand. Certain Store implementations support batch
fetching of data items for a range of Messages. Clients can use such
optimizations, for example, when filling the header-list window for a
range of messages. The FetchProfile method allows a client to list the
items it will fetch in a batch for a certain message range.

The following code illustrates the use of
FetchProfile when fetching Messages from a Folder. The client fills its
header-list window with the Subject, From, and X-mailer headers for all
messages in the folder.


[source,java]
----
Message[] msgs = folder.getMessages();
FetchProfile fp = new FetchProfile();
fp.add(FetchProfile.Item.ENVELOPE);
fp.add("X-mailer");
folder.fetch(msgs, fp);
for (int i = 0; i < folder.getMessageCount(); i++) {
    display(msgs[i].getFrom());
    display(msgs[i].getSubject());
    display(msgs[i].getHeader("X-mailer"));
}
----

====  `Folder` Events

Folders generate events to notify listeners of
any change in either the folder or in its Messages list. The client can
register listeners to a closed Folder, but generates a notification
event only after that folder is opened.

Folder supports the following events:

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",]
|===
|*ConnectionEvent*
|This event is generated when a Folder is
opened or closed.

When a Folder closes (either because the
client has called _close_ or from some external cause), all Messaging
components belonging to that Folder become invalid. Typically, clients
will attempt to recover by reopening that Folder, and then fetching
Message objects.

|*FolderEvent*
|This event is generated when the client creates, deletes or renames this
folder. Note that the Store object containing this folder can also
generate this event.

|*MessageCountEvent*
|This event notifies listeners that the message
count has changed. The following actions can cause this change:

* _Addition_ of new Messages into the Folder,
either by a delivery agent or because of an _append_ operation. The new
Message objects are included in the event.

* Removal of existing messages from this Folder.
Removed messages are referred to as _expunged_ messages. The
_isExpunged_ method returns true for removed Messages and the
_getMessageNumber_ method returns the original sequence number assigned
to that message. All other Message methods throw a
_MessageRemovedException_.
See <<a401, The Folder Class>> for a discussion of
removing deleted messages in shared
folders. The expunged Message objects are included in the event. An
expunged message is invalid and should be pruned from the client's view
as early as possible.
See <<a433, The Expunge Process>> for details on the expunge method.

|===

[[a433]]
=== The Expunge Process

Deleting messages from a Folder is a two-phase
operation. Setting the DELETED flag on messages marks them as deleted,
but it does not remove them from the Folder. The deleted messages are
removed only when the client invokes the expunge method on that Folder
pbject. The Folder object then notifies listeners by firing an
appropriate MessageEvent. The MessageEvent object contains the expunged
Message objects. Note that the expunge method also returns the expunged
Message objects. The Folder object also renumbers the messages falling
after the expunged messages in the message list. Thus, when the __
expunge method returns, the sequence number of those Message objects
will change. Note, however, that the expunged messages still retain
their original sequence numbers.

Since expunging a folder can remove some
messages from the folder and renumber others, it is important that the
client synchronize itself with the expunged folder as early as possible.
The next sections describe a set of recommendations for clients wanting
to expunge a Folder:

* Expunge the folder; close it; and then reopen
and refetch messages from that Folder. This ensures that the client was
notified of the updated folder state. In fact, the client can just issue
the _close_ method with the _expunge_ parameter set to true to force an
expunge of the Folder during the close operation, thus even avoiding the
explicit call to _expunge_ .

* The previous solution might prove to be too
simple or too drastic in some circumstances. This paragraph describes
the scenario of a more complex client expunging a single access folder;
for example, a folder that allows only one read-write connection at a
time. The recommended steps for such a client after it issues the
_expunge_ command on the folder are:

** Update its message count, either by
decrementing it by the number of expunged messages, or by invoking the
getMessageCount method on the Folder.

** If the client uses sequence numbers to
reference messages, it must account for the renumbering of Message
objects subsequent to the expunged messages. Thus if a folder has 5
messages as shown below, (sequence numbers are within parenthesis), and
if the client is notified that messages A and C are removed, it should
account for the renumbering of the remaining messages as shown in the
second figure.

image:images/mail-17.svg[image]

* The client should prune expunged messages from
its internal storage as early as possible.

* The expunge process becomes complex when
dealing with a shared folder that can be edited. Consider the case where
two clients are operating on the same folder. Each client possesses its
own Folder object, but each Folder object actually represents the same
physical folder.

If one client expunges the shared folder, any
deleted messages are physically removed from the folder. The primary
client can probably deal with this appropriately since it initiated this
process and is ready to handle the consequences. However, secondary
clients are not guaranteed to be in a state where they can handle an
unexpected Message removed event— especially if the client is heavily
multithreaded or if it uses sequence numbers.

To allow clients to handle such situations
gracefully, the Jakarta Mail API applies following restrictions to Folder
implementations:

* A Folder can remove and renumber its Messages
only when it is explicitly expunged using the _expunge_ method. When the
folder is implicitly expunged, it marks any expunged messages as
_expunged_ , but it still maintains access to those Message objects.
This means that the following state is maintained when the Folder is
implicitly expunged:

** _getMessages_ returns expunged Message
objects together with valid message objects. However; an expunged
message can throw the MessageExpungedException if direct access is
attempted.

** The messages in the Folder should not be
renumbered.

** The implicit expunge operation can not change
the total Folder message count.

A Folder can notify listeners of “implicit”
expunges by generating appropriate MessageEvents. However, the removed
field in the event must be set to false to indicate that the message is
still in the folder. When this Folder is explicitly expunged, then the
Folder must remove all expunged messages, renumber it's internal Message
cache, and generate MessageEvents for all the expunged messages, with
each removed flag set to true.

The recommended set of actions for a client
under the above situation is as follows:

* Multithreaded clients that expect to handle
shared folders are advised not to use sequence numbers.

* If a client receives a MessageEvent indicating
message removal, it should check the removed flag. If the flag is false,
this indicates that another client has removed the message from this
folder. This client might want to issue an _expunge_ request on the
folder object to synchronize it with the physical folder (but note the
caveats in the previous section about using a shared folder).
Alternatively, this client might want to close the Folder object
(without expunging) and reopen it to synchronize with the physical
folder (but note that all message objects would need to be refreshed in
this case). The client may also mark the expunged messages in order to
notify the end user.

* If the _removed_ flag was set to true, the
client should follow earlier recommendations on dealing with explicit
expunges.

=== The Search Process

Search criteria are expressed as a tree of
search-terms, forming a parse tree for the search expression. The
SearchTerm class represents search terms. This is an abstract class with
a single method:

[source,java]
----
public boolean match(Message msg);
----

Subclasses implement specific matching
algorithms by implementing the _match_ method. Thus new search terms and
algorithms can be easily introduced into the search framework by writing
the required code using the Java programming language.

The search package provides a set of standard
search terms that implement specific match criteria on Message objects.
For example, SubjectTerm pattern-matches the given String with the
subject header of the given message.

[source,java]
----
public final class SubjectTerm extends StringTerm {
    public SubjectTerm(String pattern);
    public boolean match(Message m);
}
----

The search package also provides a set of
standard logical operator terms that can be used to compose complex
search terms. These include AndTerm, OrTerm, and NotTerm.

[source,java]
----
final class AndTerm extends SearchTerm {
    public AndTerm(SearchTerm t1, SearchTerm t2);
    public boolean match(Message msg) {
        // The AND operator
        for (int i = 0; i < terms.length; i++)
            if (!terms[i].match(msg))
                return false;
        return true;
    }
}
----

The Folder class supports searches on messages
through these search method versions:

[source,java]
----
public Message[] search(SearchTerm term)
public Message[] search(SearchTerm term, Message[] msgs)
----

These methods return the _Message_ objects
matching the specified search term. The default implementation applies
the search term on each _Message_ object in the specified range. Other
implementations may optimize this; for example, the IMAP _Folder_
implementation maps the search term into an IMAP SEARCH command that the
server executes.

[[a483]]
== Jakarta Activation

Jakarta Mail relies heavily on Jakarta
Activation to determine the MIME data type, to determine
the commands available on that data, and to provide a software component
corresponding to a particular behavior.

This section explains how the Jakarta Mail and Jakarta Activation
APIs work together to manage message content. It describes how clients
using Jakarta Mail can access and operate on the content of Messages and
BodyParts. This discussion assumes you are familiar with the Jakarta Activation
specification posted at https://jakarta.ee/specifications/activation.

=== Accessing the Content

For a client using Jakarta Mail, arbitrary data is
introduced to the system in the form of mail messages. The
jakarta.mail.Part interface allows the client to access the content. Part
consists of a set of attributes and a "content". The Part interface is
the common base interface for Messages and BodyParts. A typical mail
message has one or more body parts, each of a particular MIME type.

Anything that deals with the content of a Part
will use the Part’s DataHandler. The content is available through the
DataHandlers either as an InputStream or as an object in the Java
programming language. The Part also defines convenience methods that
call through to the DataHandler. For example: the Part.getContent method
is the same as calling _Part.getDataHandler().getContent()_ and the
_Part.getInputStream_ method is the same as
_Part.getDataHandler().getInputStream()_ .

The content returned (either via an
InputStream or an object in the Java programming language) depends on the
MIME type. For example: a Part that contains textual content returns the
following:

* The _Part.getContentType_ method returns
text/plain

* The _Part.getInputStream_ method returns an
_InputStream_ containing the bytes of the text

* The _Part.getContent_ method returns a
java.lang.String object

Content is returned either as an input stream,
or as an object in the Java programming language.

* When an InputStream is returned, any
mail-specific encodings are decoded before the stream is returned.

* When an object in the Java programming
language is returned using the getContent method, the type of the
returned object depends upon the content itself. In the Jakarta Mail API,
any Part with a main content type set to “multipart/” (any kind of
multipart) should return a jakarta.mail.Multipart object from the
getContent method. A Part with a content type of message/rfc822 returns
a jakarta.mail.Message object from the getContent method.

==== Example: Message Output

This example shows how you can traverse Parts
and display the data contained in a message.

[source,java]
----
public void printParts(Part p) {
    Object o = p.getContent();
        if (o instanceof String) {
        System.out.println("This is a String");
        System.out.println((String)o);
    } else if (o instanceof Multipart) {
        System.out.println("This is a Multipart");
        Multipart mp = (Multipart)o;
        int count = mp.getCount();
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            printParts(mp.getBodyPart(i));
        }
    } else if (o instanceof InputStream) {
        System.out.println("This is just an input stream");
        InputStream is = (InputStream)o;
        int c;
        while ((c = is.read()) != -1)
            System.out.write(c);
    }
}
----

=== Operating on the Content

The DataHandler allows clients to discover the
operations available on the content of a Message, and to instantiate the
appropriate JavaBeans to perform those operations. The most common
operations on Message content are __view__, __edit__, and __print__.

====  _Example: Viewing a Message_

Consider a Message “Viewer” Bean that presents
a user interface that displays a mail message. This example shows how a
viewer bean can be used to display the content of a message (that
usually is _text/plain, text/html,_ or _multipart/mixed_).

NOTE: Perform error checking to ensure that a valid Component was created.

[source,java]
----
// message passed in as parameter
void setMessage(Message msg) {
    DataHandler dh = msg.getDataHandler();
    CommandInfo cinfo = dh.getCommand("view");
    Component comp = (Component)
    dh.getBean(cinfo);
    this.setMainViewer(comp);
}
----

====  _Example: Showing Attachments_

In this example, the user has selected an
attachment and wishes to display it in a separate dialog. The client
locates the correct viewer object as follows.

[source,java]
----
// Retrieve the BodyPart from the current attachment
BodyPart bp = getSelectedAttachment();

DataHandler dh = bp.getDataHandler();
CommandInfo cinfo = dh.getCommand("view");
Component comp = (Component) dh.getBean(cinfo);

// Add viewer to dialog Panel
MyDialog myDialog = new MyDialog();
myDialog.add(comp);

// display dialog on screen
myDialog.show();
----


See <<a597, Setting Message Content>> for examples that
construct a message for a send operation.

=== Adding Support for Content Types

Support for commands acting on message data is
an implementation task left to the client. Jakarta Mail and Jakarta Activation
APIs intend
for this support to be provided by an Activation-Aware JavaBean. Almost all data
will require _edit_ and _view_ support.

Currently, the Jakarta Mail API does not provide
_viewer JavaBeans_ .

Developers writing a Jakarta Mail client need to
write additional viewers that support some of the basic content types --
specifically _message/rfc822_, _multipart/mixed_, and
_text/plain_. These are the usual content-types encountered when
displaying a Message, and they provide the look and feel of the
application.

Content developers providing additional data types should refer to the
Jakarta Activation specification, that discusses how to
create DataContentHandlers and Beans that operate on those contents.

[[a554]]
== Message Composition

This section describes the process used to
instantiate a message object, add content to that message, and send it
to its intended list of recipients.

The Jakarta Mail API allows a client program to
create a message of arbitrary complexity. Messages are instantiated from
the Message subclass. The client program can manipulate any message as
if it had been retrieved from a Store.

=== Building a Message Object

To create a message, a client program
instantiates a Message object, sets appropriate attributes, and then
inserts the content.

* The attributes specify the message address and
other values necessary to send, route, receive, decode and store the
message. Attributes also specify the message structure and data content
type.

* Message content is carried in a DataHandler
object, that carries either data or a Multipart object. A DataHandler
carries the content body and provides methods the client uses to handle
the content. A Multipart object is a container that contains one or more
Bodypart objects, each of which can in turn contain DataHandler objects.

=== Message Creation

jakarta.mail.Message is an abstract class that
implements the Part interface. Therefore, to create a message object,
select a message subclass that implements the appropriate message type.

For example, to create a Mime message, a
Jakarta Mail client instantiates an empty jakarta.mail.internet.MimeMessage
object passing the current Session object to it:

[source,java]
----
Message msg = new MimeMessage(session);
----

=== Setting Message Attributes

The Message class provides a set of methods
that specify standard attributes common to all messages. The MimeMessage
class provides additional methods that set MIME-specific attributes. The
client program can also set non-standard attributes (custom headers) as
name-value pairs.

The methods for setting standard attributes
are listed below:

[source,java]
----
public class Message {
    public void setFrom(Address addr);
    public void setFrom(); // retrieves from system
    public void setRecipients(RecipientType type, Address[] addrs);
    public void setReplyTo(Address[] addrs);
    public void setSentDate(Date date);
    public void setSubject(String subject);
    ...
}
----

The Part interface specifies the following
method, that sets custom headers:

[source,java]
----
public void setHeader(String name, String value)
----

The setRecipients method takes a RecipientType
as its first parameter, which specifies which recipient field to use.
Currently, Message.RecipientType.TO, Message.RecipientType.CC, and
Message.RecipientType.BCC are defined. Additional RecipientTypes may be
defined as necessary.

The Message class provides two versions of the
_setFrom_ method:

* `setFrom(Address addr)` specifies the sender
explicitly from an `Address` object parameter.

* `setFrom()` retrieves the sender’s username from
the local system.

The code sample below sets attributes for the
MimeMessage just created. First, it instantiates Address objects to be
used as _To_ and _From_ addresses. Then, it calls _set_ methods, which
equate those addresses to appropriate message attributes:

[source,java]
----
toAddrs[] = new InternetAddress[1];
toAddrs[0] = new InternetAddress("luke@rebellion.gov");
Address fromAddr = new InternetAddress("han.solo@smuggler.com");

msg.setFrom(fromAddr);
msg.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, toAddrs);
msg.setSubject("Takeoff time.");
msg.setSentDate(new Date());
----

[[a597]]
=== Setting Message Content

The Message object carries content data within
a DataHandler object. To add content to a Message, a client creates
content, instantiates a DataHandler object, places content into that
DataHandler object, and places that object into a Message object that
has had its attributes defined.

The Jakarta Mail API provides two techniques that
set message content. The first technique uses the _setDataHandler
method. The second technique uses_ the _setContent_ method.

Typically, clients add content to a
DataHandler object by calling _setDataHandler(DataHandler)_ on a Message
object. The DataHandler is an object that encapsulates data. The data is
passed to the DataHandler's constructor as either a DataSource (a stream
connected to the data) or as an object in the Java programming language.
The InputStream object creates the DataSource.
See <<a483, Jakarta Activation>> for additional information.

[source,java]
----
public class DataHandler {
    DataHandler(DataSource dataSource);
    DataHandler(Object data, String mimeType);
}
----

The code sample below shows how to place text
content into an InternetMessage. First, create the text as a string
object. Then, pass the string into a DataHandler object, together with
its MIME type. Finally, add the DataHandler object to the message
object:

[source,java]
----
// create brief message text
String content = "Leave at 300.";

// instantiate the DataHandler object

DataHandler data = new DataHandler(content, "text/plain");

// Use setDataHandler() to insert data into the
// new Message object

msg.setDataHandler(data);
----

Alternately, _setContent_ implements a simpler
technique that takes the data object and its MIME type. _setContent_
creates the DataHandler object automatically:

[source,java]
----
// create the message text
String content = "Leave at 300.";

// call setContent to pass content and content type
// together into the message object

msg.setContent(content, "text/plain");
----

When the client calls _Transport.send()_ to
send this message, the recipient will receive the message below, using
either technique:

[source]
----
Date: Wed, 23 Apr 1997 22:38:07 -0700 (PDT)
From: han.solo@smuggler.com
Subject: Takeoff time
To: luke@rebellion.gov

Leave at 300.
----

=== Building a MIME Multipart Message

Follow these steps to create a MIME Multipart
Message:

. Instantiate a new MimeMultipart object, or a
subclass.

. Create MimeBodyParts for the specific message
parts. Use the _setContent_ method or the _setDataHandler_ method to
create the content for each Bodypart, as described in the previous
section.
+
--
NOTE: The default subtype for a MimeMultipart object is mixed. It can be set
to other subtypes as required. MimeMultipart subclasses might already
have their subtype set appropriately.
--
+
. Insert the Multipart object into the Message
object by calling _setContent(Multipart)_ within a newly-constructed
Message object.
+
The example below creates a Multipart object and then adds two message
parts to it. The first message part is a text string, “Spaceport Map,”
and the second contains a document of type “application/postscript.”
Finally, this multipart object is added to a MimeMessage object of the
type described above.

[source,java]
----
// Instantiate a Multipart object
MimeMultipart mp = new MimeMultipart();

// create the first bodypart object
MimeBodyPart b1 = new MimeBodyPart();

// create textual content
// and add it to the bodypart object
b1.setContent("Spaceport Map","text/plain");
mp.addBodyPart(b1);

// Multipart messages usually have more than
// one body part. Create a second body part
// object, add new text to it, and place it
// into the multipart message as well. This
// second object holds postscript data.

MimeBodyPart b2 = new MimeBodyPart();
b2.setContent(map,"application/postscript");
mp.addBodyPart(b2);

// Create a new message object as described above,
// and set its attributes. Add the multipart
// object to this message and call saveChanges()
// to write other message headers automatically.

Message msg = new MimeMessage(session);

// Set message attrubutes as in a singlepart
// message.

msg.setContent(mp); // add Multipart
msg.saveChanges(); // save changes
----

After all message parts are created and
inserted, call the _saveChanges_ method to ensure that the client writes
appropriate message headers. This is identical to the process followed
with a single part message. Note that the Jakarta Mail API calls the
_saveChanges_ method implicitly during the _send_ process, so invoking
it is unnecessary and expensive if the message is to be sent
immediately.

[[a674]]
== Transport Protocols and Mechanisms

The Transport abstract class defines the
message submission and transport protocol. Subclasses of the Transport
class implement SMTP and other transport protocols.

=== Obtaining the Transport Object

The Transport object is seldom explicitly
created. The getTransport method obtains a Transport object from the
Session factory. The Jakarta Mail API provides three versions of the
getTransport method:

[source,java]
----
public class Session {
    public Transport getTransport(Address address);
    public Transport getTransport(String protocol);
    public Transport getTransport();
}
----

* getTransport(Address address) returns the
implementation of the transport class based on the address type. A
user-extensible map defines which transport type to use for a particular
address. For example, if the address is an InternetAddress, and
InternetAddress is mapped to a protocol that supports SMTP then
SMTPTransport can be returned.

* The client can also call getTransport(“smtp”)
to request SMTP, or another transport implementation protocol.

* _getTransport()_ returns the transport
specified in the _mail.transport.protocol_ property.

See <<a219, The Mail Session>> for details.

==== Transport Methods

The Transport class provides the connect and
protocolConnect methods, which operate similarly to those on the Store
class. See <<a378, The Store Class>> for details.

A Transport object generates a ConnectionEvent
to notify its listeners of a successful or a failed connection. A
Transport object can throw an IOException if the connection fails.

Transport implementations should ensure that
the message specified is of a known type. If the type is known, then the
Transport object sends the message to its specified destinations. If the
type is not known, then the Transport object can attempt to reformat the
Message object into a suitable version using gatewaying techniques, or
it can throw a MessagingException, indicating failure. For example, the
SMTP transport implementation recognizes MimeMessages. It invokes the
writeTo method on a MimeMessage object to generate a RFC822 format byte
stream that is sent to the SMTP host.

The message is sent using the _Transport.send_
static method or the _sendMessage_ instance method. The _Transport.send_
method is a convenience method that instantiates the transports
necessary to send the message, depending on the recipients' addresses,
and then passes the message to each transport's _sendMessage_ method.
Alternatively, the client can get the transport that implements a
particular protocol itself and send the message using the _sendMessage_
method. This adds the benefit of being able to register as event
listeners on the individual transports.

Note that the Address[] argument passed to the
send and _sendMessage_ methods do not need to match the addresses
provided in the message headers. Although these arguments usually will
match, the end-user determines where the messages are actually sent.
This is useful for implementing the Bcc: header, and other similar
functions.

=== Transport Events

Clients can register as listeners for events
generated by transport implementations. (Note that the abstract
Transport class doesn't fire any events, only particular protocol
implementations generate events). There are two events generated:
_ConnectionEvent_ and _TransportEvent_ .

==== `ConnectionEvent`

If the transport connects successfully, it
will fire the ConnectionEvent with the type set to OPENED. If the
connection times out or is closed, ConnectionEvent with type CLOSED is
generated.

==== `TransportEvent`

The sendMessage method generates a
TransportEvent to its listeners. That event contains information about
the method’s success or failure. There are three types of
TransportEvent: MESSAGE_DELIVERED, MESSAGE_NOT_DELIVERED _,_
MESSAGE_PARTIALLY_DELIVERED. The event contains three arrays of
addresses: validSent[], validUnsent[], and invalid[] that list the valid
and invalid addresses for this message and protocol.

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%"]
|===
|Transport Event
|Description

| `MESSAGE_DELIVERED`
|When the message has been successfully sent
to all recipients by this transport. _validSent[]_ contains all the
addresses. _validUnsent[]_ and _invalid[]_ are null.

| `MESSAGE_NOT_DELIVERED`
|When _ValidSent[]_ is null, the message was
not successfully sent to any recipients. _validUnsent[]_ may have
addresses that are valid. _invalidSent[]_ may contain invalid addresses.

| `MESSAGE_PARTIALLY_DELIVERED`
|Message was successfully sent to some
recipients but not to all. _ValidSent[]_ holds addresses of recipients
to whom the message was sent. _validUnsent[]_ holds valid addresses but
the message wasn't sent to them. _invalid[]_ holds invalid addresses.
|===

=== Using The `Transport` Class

The code segment below sends a MimeMessage
using a Transport class implementing the SMTP protocol. The client
creates two InternetAddress objects that specify the recipients and
retrieves a Transport object from the default Session that supports
sending messages to Internet addresses. Then the Session object uses a
Transport object to send the message.

[source,java]
----
// Get a session
Session session = Session.getInstance(props, null);

// Create an empty MimeMessage and its part
Message msg = new MimeMessage(session);
... add headers and message parts as before

// create two destination addresses
Address[] addrs = {new InternetAddress("mickey@disney.com"),
    new InternetAddress("goofy@disney.com")};

// get a transport that can handle sending message to
// InternetAddresses. This will probably map to a transport
// that supports SMTP.
Transport trans = session.getTransport(addrs[0]);

// add ourselves as ConnectionEvent and TransportEvent listeners
trans.addConnectionListener(this);
trans.addTransportListener(this);

// connect method determines what host to use from the
// session properties
trans.connect();

// send the message to the addresses we specified above
trans.sendMessage(msg, addrs);
----


== Internet Mail

The Jakarta Mail specification does not define any
implementation. However, the API does include a set of classes that
implement Internet Mail standards. Although not part of the
specification, these classes can be considered part of the Jakarta Mail
package. They show how to adapt an existing messaging architecture to
the Jakarta Mail framework.

These classes implement the Internet Mail
Standards defined by the RFCs listed below:

* RFC822 (Standard for the Format of Internet
Text Messages)

* RFC2045, RFC2046, RFC2047 (MIME)

RFC822 describes the structure of messages
exchanged across the Internet. Messages are viewed as having a header
and contents. The header is composed of a set of standard and optional
header fields. The header is separated from the content by a blank line.
The RFC specifies the syntax for all header fields and the semantics of
the standard header fields. It does not however, impose any structure on
the message contents.

The MIME RFCs 2045, 2046 and 2047 define
message content structure by defining structured body parts, a typing
mechanism for identifying different media types, and a set of encoding
schemes to encode data into mail-safe characters.

The Internet Mail package allows clients to
create, use and send messages conforming to the standards listed above.
It gives service providers a set of base classes and utilities they can
use to implement Stores and Transports that use the Internet mail
protocols. See <<a1917, MimeMessage Object Hierarchy>> for a Mime class
and interface hierarchy diagram.

The Jakarta Mail MimePart interface models an
entity as defined in RFC2045, Section 2.4. MimePart extends the Jakarta Mail
Part interface to add MIME-specific methods and semantics. The
MimeMessage and MimeBodyPart classes implement the MimePart interface.
The following figure shows the class hierarchy of these classes.

image:images/mail-23.svg[image]

=== The `MimeMessage` Class

The MimeMessage class extends Message and
implements MimePart. This class implements an email message that
conforms to the RFC822 and MIME standards.

The MimeMessage class provides a default
constructor that creates an empty MimeMessage object. The client can
fill in the message later by invoking the _parse_ method on an RFC822
input stream. Note that the _parse_ method is protected, so that only
this class and its subclasses can use this method. Service providers
implementing ’light-weight’ Message objects that are filled in on demand
can generate the appropriate byte stream and invoke the _parse_ method
when a component is requested from a message. Service providers that can
provide a separate byte stream for the message body (distinct from the
message header) can override the _getContentStream_ method.

The client can also use the default
constructor to create new MimeMessage objects for sending. The client
sets appropriate attributes and headers, inserts content into the
message object, and finally calls the _send_ method for that MimeMessage
object.

This code sample creates a new MimeMessage
object for sending. See <<a554, Message Composition>> and
<<a674, Transport Protocols and Mechanisms>> for details.

[source,java]
----
MimeMessage m = new MimeMessage(session);
// Set FROM:
m.setFrom(new InternetAddress("jmk@Sun.COM"));
// Set TO:
InternetAddress a[] = new InternetAddress[1];
a[0] = new InternetAddress("javamail@Sun.COM");
m.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, a);
// Set content
m.setContent(data, "text/plain");
// Send message
Transport.send(m);
----

The MimeMessage class also provides a
constructor that uses an input stream to instantiate itself. The
constructor internally invokes the _parse_ method to fill in the
message. The InputStream object is left positioned at the end of the
message body.

[source,java]
----
InputStream in = getMailSource(); // a stream of mail messages
MimeMessage m = null;
for (;;) {
    try {
        m = new MimeMessage(session,in);
    } catch (MessagingException ex) {
        // reached end of message stream
        break;
    }
}
----

MimeMessage implements the writeTo method by
writing an RFC822-formatted byte stream of its headers and body. This is
accomplished in two steps: First, the MimeMessage object writes out its
headers; then it delegates the rest to the DataHandler object
representing the content.

=== The `MimeBodyPart` Class

The MimeBodyPart class extends BodyPart and
implements the MimePart interface. This class represents a Part inside a
Multipart. MimeBodyPart implements a _Body Part_ as defined by RFC2045,
Section 2.5.

The getBodyPart(int index) returns the
MimeBodyPart object at the given index. MimeMultipart also allows the
client to fetch MimeBodyPart objects based on their Content-IDs.

The addBodyPart method adds a new
MimeBodyPart object to a MimeMultipart as a step towards constructing a
new multipart MimeMessage.

=== The `MimeMultipart` Class

The MimeMultipart class extends Multipart and
models a MIME multipart content within a message or a body part.

A MimeMultipart is obtained from a MimePart
containing a ContentType attribute set to _multipart_ , by invoking that
part's _getContent_ method.

The client creates a new MimeMultipart object
by invoking its default constructor. To create a new multipart
MimeMessage, create a MimeMultipart object (or its subclass); use set
methods to fill in the appropriate MimeBodyParts; and finally, use
_setContent(Multipart)_ to insert it into the MimeMessage.

MimeMultipart also provides a constructor that
takes an input stream positioned at the beginning of a MIME multipart
stream. This class parses the input stream and creates the child body
parts.

The _getSubType_ method returns the multipart
message MIME subtype. The subtype defines the relationship among the
individual body parts of a multipart message. More semantically complex
multipart subtypes are implemented as subclasses of MimeMultipart,
providing additional methods that expose specific functionality.

Note that a multipart content object is
treated like any other content. When parsing a MIME Multipart stream,
the Jakarta Mail implementation uses the Jakarta Activation framework
to locate a suitable
DataContentHandler for the specific subtype and uses that handler to
create the appropriate Multipart instance. Similarly, when generating
the output stream for a Multipart object, the appropriate
DataContentHandler is used to generate the stream.

=== The `MimeUtility` Class

MimeUtility is a utility class that provides
MIME-related functions. All methods in this class are static methods.
These methods currently perform the functions listed below:

==== Content Encoding and Decoding

Data sent over RFC 821/822-based mail systems
are restricted to 7-bit US-ASCII bytes. Therefore, any non-US-ASCII
content needs to be encoded into the 7-bit US-ASCII (mail-safe) format.
MIME (RFC 2045) specifies the “base64” and “quoted-printable” encoding
schemes to perform this encoding. The following methods support content
encoding:

* The getEncoding method takes a DataSource
object and returns the Content-Transfer-Encoding that should be applied
to the data in that DataSource object to make it mail-safe.

* The encode method wraps an encoder around the
given output stream based on the specified Content-Transfer-Encoding.
The decode method decodes the given input stream, based on the specified
Content-Transfer-Encoding.

==== Header Encoding and Decoding

RFC 822 restricts the data in message headers
to 7bit US-ASCII characters. MIME (RFC 2047) specifies a mechanism to
encode non 7bit US-ASCII characters so that they are suitable for
inclusion in message headers. This section describes the methods that
enable this functionality.

The header-related methods (getHeader,
setHeader) in Part and Message operate on Strings. String objects
contain (16 bit) Unicode characters.

Since RFC 822 prohibits non US-ASCII
characters in headers, clients invoking the setHeader() methods must
ensure that the header values are appropriately encoded if they contain
non US-ASCII characters.

The encoding process (based on RFC 2047)
consists of two steps:

. Convert the Unicode String into an array of
bytes in another charset. This step is required because Unicode is not
yet a widely used charset. Therefore, a client must convert the Unicode
characters into a charset that is more palatable to the recipient.

. Apply a suitable encoding format that ensures
that the bytes obtained in the previous step are mail-safe.

The encodeText method combines the two steps
listed above to create an encoded header. Note that as RFC 2047
specifies, only “unstructured” headers and user-defined extension
headers can be encoded. It is prudent coding practice to run such header
values through the encoder to be safe. Also note that the encodeText
method encodes header values only if they contain non US-ASCII
characters.

The reverse of this process (decoding) needs
to be performed when handling header values obtained from a MimeMessage
or MimeBodyPart using the getHeader set of methods, since those headers
might be encoded as per RFC 2047. The decodeText method takes a header
value, applies RFC 2047 decoding standards, and returns the decoded
value as a Unicode String. Note that this method should be invoked only
on “unstructured” or user-defined headers. Also note that decodeText
attempts decoding only if the header value was encoded in RFC 2047
style. It is advised that you always run header values through the
decoder to be safe.

=== The `ContentType` Class

The ContentType class is a utility class that
parses and generates MIME content-type headers.

To parse a MIME content-Type value, create a
ContentType object and invoke the toString method.

The ContentType class also provides methods
that match Content-Type values.

The following code fragment illustrates the
use of this class to extract a MIME parameter.

[source,java]
----
String type = part.getContentType();
ContentType cType = new ContentType(type);

if (cType.match("application/x-foobar"))
    String color = cType.getParameter("color");
----

This code sample uses this class to construct
a MIME Content-Type value:

[source,java]
----
ContentType cType = new ContentType();
cType.setPrimaryType("application");
cType.setSubType("x-foobar");
cType.setParameter("color", "red");

String contentType = cType.toString();
----

== Provider Requirements

Jakarta Mail provider must implement _jakarta.mail.util.StreamProvider_ interface. Through
this interface, an implementation of the Jakarta Mail Specification provides different
encoders and decoders required by the Jakarta Mail APIs.

[appendix]
[[a823]]
== Environment Properties

This section lists some of the environment
properties that are used by the Jakarta Mail APIs. The Jakarta Mail javadocs
contain additional information on properties supported by Jakarta Mail.

Note that Applets can not determine some
defaults listed in this Appendix. When writing an applet, you must
specify the properties you require.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Property
|Description
|Default Value

| *mail.store.protocol*
|Specifies the default Message Access
Protocol. The _Session.getStore()_ method returns a Store object that
implements this protocol. The client can override this property and
explicitly specify the protocol with the _Session.getStore(String
protocol_ _)_ method.
|The first appropriate protocol in the config files

| *mail.transport.protocol*
|Specifies the default Transport Protocol. The
_Session.getTransport()_ method returns a _Transport_ object that
implements this protocol. The client can override this property and
explicitly specify the protocol by using _Session.getTransport(String
protocol) method_ .
|The first appropriate protocol in the config files

| *mail.host*
|Specifies the default Mail server. The
_Store_ and _Transport object’s_ _connect_ methods use this property, if
the protocol-specific host property is absent, to locate the target
host.
|The local machine

| *mail.user*
|Specifies the username to provide when
connecting to a Mail server. The _Store_ and _Transport_ object’s
_connect_ methods use this property, if the protocol-specific username
property is absent, to obtain the username.
| _user.name_

| *mail.__protocol__.host*
|Specifies the protocol-specific default Mail
server. This overrides the _mail.host_ property.
| _mail.host_

| *mail.__protocol__.user*
|Specifies the protocol-specific default
username for connecting to the Mail server. This overrides the
_mail.user_ property.
| _mail.user_

| *mail.from*
|Specifies the return address of the current
user. Used by the _InternetAddress.getLocalAddress_ method to specify
the current user’s email address.
| _username@host_

| *mail.debug*
|Specifies the initial debug mode. Setting this
property to _true_ will turn on debug mode, while setting it to _false_
turns debug mode off.

Note that the _Session.setDebug_ method also
controls the debug mode.

|false

[appendix]
== Message Security

=== Overview

This is not a full specification of how
Message Security will be integrated into the Jakarta Mail system. This is a
description of implementation strategy. The purpose of this section is
to declare that it is possible to integrate message security, not to
define how it will be integrated. The final design for Message Security
will change based on feedback and finalization of the S/MIME IETF
specification.

This section discusses encrypting/decrypting
messages, and signing/verifying signatures. It will not discuss how
Security Restrictions on untrusted or signed applets will work, nor will
it discuss a general authentication model for Stores (For example; a GSS
API in the Java platform.)

==== Displaying an Encrypted/Signed Message

Displaying an encrypted or signed message is
the same as displaying any other message. The client uses the
_DataHandler_ for that encrypted message together with the "view"
command. This returns a bean that displays the data. There will be both
a multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted viewer bean (can be the same
bean). The beans will need to be aware of the
MultiPartSigned/MultiPartEncrypted classes.

==== MultiPartEncrypted/Signed Classes

The Jakarta Mail API will probably add two new
content classes: _MultiPartEncrypted_ and _MultiPartSigned_ . They
subclass the _MultiPart_ class and handle the MIME types
multipart/encrypted and multipart/signed. There are many possible
"protocols" that specify how a message has been encrypted and/or signed.
The MPE/MPS classes will find all the installed protocols. The
_ContentType_ ’s protocol parameter determines which protocol class to
use. There needs to be a standard registration of protocol objects or a
way to search for valid packages and instantiate a particular class. The
_MultiPart_ classes will hand off the control information, other
parameters, and the data to be manipulated (either the signed or
encrypted block) through some defined _Protocol_ interface.

==== Reading the Contents

There will be times when an applet/application
needs to retrieve the content of the message without displaying it. The
code sample below shows one possible technique with a message containing
encrypted content:

[source,java]
----
Message msg = // message gotten from some folder.
if (msg.isMimeType("multipart/encrypted")) {
    Object o = msg.getContent();
    if (o instanceof MultiPartEncrypted) {
        MultiPartEncrypted mpe = (MultiPartEncrypted) o;
        mpe.decrypt();
            // use the default keys/certs from the user.
            // We should also be able to determine
            // whether or not to interact with the user

        // should then be able to use the multipart methods to
        // get any contained blocks
    }
}
----

The _getContent_ method returns a
_MultiPartEncrypted_ object. There will be methods on this class to
decrypt the content. The decryption could either determine which keys
needed to be used, use the defaults (maybe the current user’s keys) or
explicitly pass which keys/certificates to use.

==== Verifying Signatures

Applications/applets will need to verify the
validity of a signature. The code sample below shows how this might be
done:

[source,java]
----
Message msg = // message gotten from some folder
if (msg.isMimeType("multipart/signed")) {
    Object o = msg.getContent();
    if (o instanceof MultiPartSigned) {
        MultiPartSigned mps = (MultiPartSigned) o;
        boolean validsig = mps.verifySignature();

        // could already get the other blocks
        // even if it wasn't a valid signature
    }
}
----

If the signature is invalid, the application
can still access the data. There will be methods in _MultiPartSigned_
that allow the setting of which keys or certificates to use when
verifying the signature.

==== Creating a Message

There are two methods for creating an
Encrypted/Signed message. Users will probably see an editor bean for the
content types multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted. These beans
would handle the UI components to allow the user to select how they want
to encrypt/sign the message. The beans could be integrated into an
application’s Message Composition window.

==== Encrypted/Signed

The non-GUI method of creating the messages
involves using the MultiPartEncrypted/Signed classes. The classes can be
created and used as the content for a message. The following code shows
how might work:

[source,java]
----
MultiPartEncrypted mpe = new MultiPartEncrypted();
// Can setup parameters for how you want to encrypt the
// message; otherwise, it will use the user's preferences.
// Set the content you wish to encrypt (to encrypt multiple
// contents a multipart/mixed block should be used)
String ourContent = "Please encrypt me!";
mpe.setContent(ourContent);

MimeMessage m = new MimeMessage(session);
m.setContent(mpe);
----

The message will be encrypted when the message
is sent. There will be other methods that allow the setting of which
encryption scheme shall be used, and the keys involved.

Creating a Multipart Signed message is very
similar to creating a Multipart Encrypted message, except that a
Multipart Signed object is created instead.

== Revision History

This appendix lists the significant changes that have been made during
the development of the Java Mail Specification.

=== Jakarta Mail 2.1

* Added _jakarta.mail.util.StreamProvider_ interface.

=== Jakarta Mail 2.0

* Created document from Java Mail 1.6 Final Release specification.
* The document was converted to Asciidoc format.
* Packages of all API classes were changed to jakarta.persistence.
These changes are reflected in the specification document.
